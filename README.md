# slide

A small library that is used to create custom sliding content by providing us with necessary **HTML** and **CSS** that would take long time to write manually.

### Sliding content

Sliding content can be anything â€” news, images, icons, etc.

You can think of sliding content as several boxes, where:
- minimum number of boxes is 2,
- each box has its width and height,
- boxes are placed horizontally, one next to each other,
- total width of boxes is usually larger that the page width or parent container width,
- boxes are sliding from left to right in some defined speed.

### Usage

You can use **Slide** by opening `index.html` that utilizes the library with nice live preview, or manually.

To use **Slide** manually, you will need the `./scripts/slide.js` file, and this [documentation](SLIDE.md).
